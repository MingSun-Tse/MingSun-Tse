### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [SMILE Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) of Northeastern University (Boston, USA). Before that, I spent seven wonderful years at Zhejiang Univeristy (Hangzhou, China) to get my B.E. and M.S. degrees. 

I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision and machine learning. My research works orbit [efficient deep learning](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/EfficientDNNs) (a.k.a. model compression), spanning from the most common image classifcation task ([GReg](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/Regularization-Pruning), [Awesome-PaI](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/Awesome-Pruning-at-Initialization), [TPP](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/TPP)) to neural style transfer ([Collaborative-Distillation](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/Collaborative-Distillation)), single image super-resolution ([ASSL](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/ASSL), [SRP](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/SRP)), and 3D novel view synthesis ([R2L](https://snap-research.github.io/R2L/)).

I do my best towards [easily reproducible](https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/smilelogging) research.
