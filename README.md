### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Assistant Professor at Westlake University (Hangzhou, China). I did my PhD at [SMILE Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) of Northeastern University (Boston, USA). Before that, I spent seven wonderful years at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) to get my B.E. and M.S. degrees. I work on Efficient AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and MLSys. See [my webpage](https://huanwang.tech/) for more information.
